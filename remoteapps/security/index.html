<h2 id="app-descriptor-authenticity">App Descriptor Authenticity</h2>
<p>It is important for users to be able to verify the origins of remote apps. If
an app claims to be provided by twitter.com, the user must be able to verify
this.</p>
<p>To do this, remote apps can provide a standard X.509 certificate along with
their app descriptor file. This file must be named cert.pem and be placed in
the root directory of the repository for Bitbucket to discover it.</p>
<p>The developer then uses the certificate to produce a SHA1 digest of the
descriptor XML file and then cryptographically signing that with his private
key that must be stored with filename <code>bitbucket-app.sha1</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nv">$</span> <span class="nv">openssl</span> <span class="n">dgst</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">sha1</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">sign</span> <span class="n">privatekey</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pem</span> <span class="o">\</span>
<span class="o">-</span><span class="n">out</span> <span class="n">bitbucket</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sha1</span> <span class="n">bitbucket</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">xml</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This certificate can be self-signed, or signed by an official public signing
authority. In the latter case, Bitbucket will decorate your remote app entry
with a visual indication, similar to what browsers do.</p>
<p>Since remote app descriptors always live in a public repository on Bitbucket,
accessible to all, users can check to see if the app provided an X.509
certificate file. If it didn't, then the user knows that it may not have come
from where it claims and make a more informed decision on whether or not to
enable or authorize the remote app.</p>
<h2 id="request-authenticity">Request Authenticity</h2>
<p>The URLs published in an app descriptor file are accessed either directly by
Bitbucket, or by a user's browser. The former is the case for example when
asynchronous events related to a repository or user profile are delivered to
the remote app, while the latter is the case for custom tabs that contain
iframes with content from the remote app.</p>
<p>It is crucial for a remote app to be able to verify that the incoming request
was initiated by Bitbucket and ignore requests that are not.</p>
<p>This is important for example for the endpoint that receives repo events.
Without the ability to verify the authenticity of such incoming requests,
anyone could push events to the remote app.</p>
<p>It is also important for browser requests to iframes (UI tabs), because it
saves the remote app from having to use the Bitbucket REST API to actively
check whether the user has at least read access to the repository.</p>
<p>Bitbucket will never link to a remote repo tab for users without read access
to that repository and so any request that does come in proves to the remote
app that the user has sufficient privileges.</p>
<p>If this wasn't available, a remote app that is enabled on a private repository
would, for every incoming request, have to hit the Bitbucket REST API to check
the user's access level on that repository, significantly impacting
performance.</p>
<h3 id="outbound-request-signing">Outbound Request Signing</h3>
<p>Every request made to the remote app that was directly or indirectly initiated
by Bitbucket gets signed with a cryptographic signature. For this, we use
standard 2-Legged OAuth (or more accurately: <a href="http://blog.nerdbank.net/2011/06/what-is-2-legged-oauth.html">0-Legged
OAuth</a>).</p>
<p>Bitbucket remote apps follows OAuth 1.0 as described in
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849">RFC-5849</a>.</p>
<p>As the signing method we use RSA-SHA1, for which we use the private key that
backs Bitbucket's own SSL certificate. The reason for this is that this
certificate contains our public RSA key and is signed by a reputable signing
authority.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it would be possible to also support HMAC-SHA1 using the shared
secret that was issued to the remote app when it applied for a consumer key.
In reality however, Bitbucket retains no link between OAuth consumer keys and
secrets that have been given out and remote apps that have been registered,
which means it would not know which consumer secret to use.</p>
<p>It is up to the remote app to check the authenticity of incoming requests.
Bitbucket cannot enforce this. However, Bitbucket will always sign every
request made to a remote app, either directly from its servers, or indirectly
through the URL of an iframe loaded by a browser.</p>
<h2 id="limited-api-privileges">Limited API Privileges</h2>
<p>Bitbucket does not yet support this, but we should be able to limit the amount
of access remote apps can get on the REST API. This access level scoping
should be tied to the access token.</p>
<p>The deployment descriptor should declare level of access it requires and this
should be presented to the user as part of the existing dialog that is used to
authorize remote apps by Bitbucket users.</p>
<p>This can be added to Bitbucket at a later stage.</p>
<p>In contrast to Atlassian Remote Apps, Bitbucket does not necessarily need to
place additional restrictions on hot redeployments that require greater API
access than the previous version of the app.</p>
<p>Where Atlassian Remote Apps negotiates its level of API access at deploy time,
Bitbucket Remote Apps relies solely on 3LO and its API access is therefor tied
to each individual access token. A redeploy of the app that requires greater
levels of access will not silently impact any user, for the existing access
tokens' privileges are fixed.</p>
<p>Instead, for the remote app to actually perform requests with the greater
level of access, it will have to purge its users' access tokens and force them
to re-authorize the app through the standard OAuth dance, during which it will
have to persuade the user to accept this.</p>
<p>A hot redeploy of a remote app that requires greater API access is therefor safe.</p>
